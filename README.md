# Event-Driven-Programming-GUI
Developed a standalone Java GUI application simulating an e-store, Nile Dot Com. The application allowed users to add items to a shopping cart, calculate totals with tax, produce an invoice, and log transactions. 

Key features included:

● User input areas for item ID and quantity.
● Six functional buttons for user interaction, with accessibility based on the order process stage.
● Secure transaction logging to a CSV file with unique transaction IDs generated from the date/time.
● Managed inventory from a CSV file, ensuring data integrity and efficient processing.
